NOTE: There is a bug in the PyPi version of this library. 
Instead of 

    from jawbone import Jawbone

Just do

    from jawbone.jawbone import Jawbone
    
There are a few other bugs like https: v/s http: header, which would resolve soon (hopefully :) )


JawboneUP API

This is a wrapper for the Jawbone UP API. 
It has convenience methods for auth, access token, refresh token, and api calls.

For terminologies, refer to the documentation here:
https://jawbone.com/up/developer/authentication

Usage: 

    from jawbone import Jawbone
    jb = Jawbone(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope='')

The app can be authorized for accessing specific data using the "scope"
The parameter “scope”, by default is 'basic_read', which can be set as per the application’s requirements.
Multiple scopes can be authorized by using space delimiters. 

To see the list of available scopes, refer:
https://jawbone.com/up/developer/authentication
(under the heading The “scopes” allowed by the system are)

So, to use the package:

1. Initialization:

    jb = Jawbone(client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri, scope='basic_read extended_read')

To make calls on behalf of the user, refer this documentation:
https://jawbone.com/up/developer/authentication

To get the authorization token:

    jb.auth() 


This call fetches the authentication URL. You should redirect the user to the generated authentication url. Upon successful authorization, the user is redirected to the “redirect_uri” specified. The “code” is specified as a GET parameter.

If there was an error, the response would be to the “redirect_uri” with GET parameter “error” 


2. Access Token

Once we have the code, you can get the auth code by calling 

    token = jb.access_token(code)
	
Save the generated token response json.

The response, if 200 has the following components as json:

access_token, token_type, expires_at, refresh_token

Store these in the database, for future api calls.

3. Refresh Token

The generated token from the above step has an expiry of 1 year. 
The refresh token provided as a part of the access_token() call, can be used to obtain the new credentials 

    response = jb.refresh_token_call(refresh_code)


4. API Calls

api_call is a generic method for calling any endpoint.
Documentation on endpoints here:
https://jawbone.com/up/developer/endpoints

To make an API call to get sleep data: 

    endpoint = nudge/api/v.1.0/sleep
    response = jb.api_call(access_token, endpoint)

A response is a json with status_code (200, 400, etc). Parse the json for the response data
If response.status == 200, the response.get(“error”) contains the message. 

	

The library dependencies include:

    urllib
    requests
